# SS1100: Intro to Programming for Space Applications
## Final Project: Programming Spacecraft Systems

### Assignment
- **Instructions**: Work in groups of four to complete the steps outlined in the project.
- **Submission**: Turn in screenshots, code snippets, and a report directly to the instructor.

### Procedure
#### Preparation
- Employ programming skills to solve problems related to spacecraft subsystems.
- Develop code and responses to tasks in various sections.
- Experience working with code and collaborating on a coding project.

#### Requirements
